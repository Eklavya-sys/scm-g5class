Project Title: AI content generator
Description: Creators on Instagram can build an AI as an extension of themselves that can answer common DM questions and story replies. Creators have control: they can customize it based on things like their Instagram content, facts about themselves and topics to avoid. Responses from creator AIs are clearly labeled, so there's full transparency for fans.
